\section{Inputs:}
Our inputs are 
\begin{itemize}
	\item An image 2D to perform face detection.
	\item The OpenCV file \textbf{haarcascade\_frontalface\_alt.xml} that contains the feature functions to detect faces.
	\item Scale update option that updates the size of the windows (pixel array).
\end{itemize}
The \textbf{windows} are the array of pixels where the feature functions are applied, so they have many scales to search for faces of many sizes.
